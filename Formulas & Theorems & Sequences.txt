Number of spanning trees with N nodes = N^(N-2)

Number of spanning trees in complete bipartite graph G(x,y) = x^(y-1) * y^(x-1)

For two coprime positive integers m and n, that largest number that cannot be written as 
am + bn (cannot be made by adding up m and n) will be m*n — m — n.

For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of positive integers whose sum is n is equal to 
the number of (k − 1)-element subsets of a set with n − 1 elements. Choose(n-1,k-1)

For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is n is equal to 
the number of multisets of cardinality k − 1 taken from a set of size n + 1. Choose(n+k-1,k-1)

ats = 0;
for(int k=0; k<=r; k++)
ats+=Choose(m,k)*Choose(n,r-k);
is same as ats = Choose(m+n,r)

ats = 0;
for(int i=r; i<=n; i++)
ats+=Choose(i,r);
is same as ats = Choose(n+1,r+1)

ats = 0;
for(int k=0; k<=n; k++)
ats+=Choose(n,k);
is same as ats = 2^n

ats = 0;
for(int m=0; m<=n; m++)
ats+=Choose(m,k);
is same as ats = Choose(n+1,k+1)

ats = 0;
for(int k=0; k<=m; k++)
ats+=Choose(n+k,k);
is same as ats = Choose(n+m+1,m)

ats = 0;
for(int k=0; k<=n; k++)
ats+=Choose(n,k)^2;
is same as ats = Choose(2*n,n)

ats = 0;
for(int k=0; k<=n; k++)
ats+=k*Choose(n,k);
is same as ats = n*2^(n-1)

"In an election where candidate A receives p votes and candidate B receives q votes with p > q, what is the probability
that A will be strictly ahead of B throughout the count?" The answer is (p-q)/(p+q)

Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

In number theory, Wilson's theorem states that a natural number n > 1 is a prime number if and only if the product of all 
the positive integers less than n is one less than a multiple of n. So n is prime if and only if (n-1)! mod n = -1

Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be represented uniquely as the sum of one or more distinct 
Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

A multiplicative functions is a function f(x) which satisfies f(a*b) = f(a)*f(b)
let d(n) - count of divisors of n
let σ(n) - sum of divisors of n
Both σ() and d() are multiplicative

Cos theorem: a*a = b*b + c*c - 2*b*c*cosAlpha

Dividing a circle into areas by means of an inscribed polygon with n sides in such a way as to maximise the number of areas created by the edges and diagonals, sometimes called Moser's circle problem, has a solution by an inductive method. The greatest possible number of regions, rG = choose( n, 4 ) + choose( n, 2) + 1, giving the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 57, 99, 163, 256

If we have repeating fraction like 0.abc where abc is repeating we can convert to normal fraction easilly: its just abc/999 or just all repeating_digits divided by #count_ofRepeatingDigits nines
